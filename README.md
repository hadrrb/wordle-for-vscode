# Wordle for Visual Studio Code

A simple Visual Studio Code extension allowing to play Wordle directly from the editor.

The game is available directly from Visual Studio Code sidebar and the extension allows to load different versions of Wordle.

**The original English version is not available anymore, since the transition to New York Times website, because of the impossibility to embed it into a simple html file.**

**Instead you can play Wordle+ by @MikhaD.**
